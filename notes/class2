Class 2

Version control system: (VCS)
    - Helps us manage our software
        - GIT, SVN, Hg, TFS

    Stuff they do 
        centralized: One repo where the whole project will live
		- Can be hosted on cloud
		- Can be on server 
		- if want connect to server they connect to where it lives and has older version of code to compare 
			- Source of truth one true 

        distuibute:
		- Git is a distributed  (DVCS)
			- If you have copy of code you have access to whole history of previous copies and current code
			- Git has good property compared to other SVN

4 PLACES NEED TO JUGGLE IN MIND 
 	* Working directory
		- Make changes in working directory 
		- Parts other programs can see besides git
         |
	   git add
	     |
	* Index
		-Staging area
		- Put stuff before you commit it 
          |
	 git clone
          |
	* local repo
		- Graph of commits 
		- Graph because every commit has a previous commit and you can branch off so wonâ€™t be a straight line
		- They connect again for a merge
         |
	git push
	     |
	*remote repo
